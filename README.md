# basket-service

This service yields the basket for a user who visits the site.

Consider this service to be a stepping stone towards different sorts of information being attached to the logged in user through patterns which are common in frontend technologies.  This specific repository will evolve more towards supprting  shopping baskets rather than towards the generic applications.
